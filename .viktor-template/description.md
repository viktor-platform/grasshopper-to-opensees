This template app demonstrates how to perform a structural analysis of a 3D frame building which is created using Grasshopper 
and display the results using VIKTOR. The structural analysis is conducted with OpenSees, a powerful and widely-used software for analyzing the 
structural response of structural and geotechnical systems to loads.

Features include:
- Import and visualization of the 3D geometry from Grasshopper 
- Definition of loads 
- Running the structural analysis 
- Visualization of the deformed building
